# Christmas Card Demo 2021

## TODO
## City
- [x] Don't have "addHouse", just use housetable to have a string of houses and go with that.
- [x] a thought; addHouse randomly choeses from houses to add to houseTable which also gives the X 
        coOrd as (128+[8 * index number]) and remebers that so when it reaches 0 it pops back up ready 
        to go for the next time around does that work? Eh, probably not.

### Text
