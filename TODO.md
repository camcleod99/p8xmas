# TODO
## City
- [x] Don't have "addHouse", just use housetable to have a string of houses and go with that.
- [x] a thought; addHouse randomly choeses from houses to add to houseTable which also gives the X 
        coOrd as (128+[8 * index number]) and remebers that so when it reaches 0 it pops back up ready 
        to go for the next time around does that work? Eh, probably not.

## Text
- [x] Get this going 

## Music
- [x] Learn Music
- [x] Yeah, ok -_-;;;

## Compile Code into single p8
- [] Is there a way to replace #include with the contents of the include? Investigate further
- [] Maybe something with Gulp?
